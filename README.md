# -Cancerous-Cell-Identification-By-Machine-Learning
Developed a system to classify cancer-infected blood cells by analyzing red and green color percentages in cell images. Utilized a CNN model for image classification, implemented with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, and deployed via a Flask web application. This project aids in efficient cell viability analysis for medical diagnostics.
